<p id="description">This web app utilizes the Strike API to facilitate lightning payments so merchants can get paid in their local currency. I was inspired to create this web application by small business owners who are charged high fees on card payments by companies such as Visa and Mastercard. The Strike API provides an option for these small business owners to use a cheaper payment rail via the Bitcoin lightning network.</p>
