<p id="description">This web app utilizes the Strike API to facilitate lightning payments so merchants can get paid in their local currency. I was inspired to create this web application by small business owners who are charged high fees on card payments by companies such as Visa and Mastercard. The Strike API provides an option for these small business owners to use a cheaper payment rail via the Bitcoin lightning network.</p>

<h3>Add to Cart & Checkout</h3>
<p>Once our shop owner gets a new customer order, they head to the order page, add the items to cart, checkout, and select "Generate Invoice" in order to generate a lightning invoice. The Strike API generates the lightning invoice and the shop owner is directed to a page with the generated QR code. The customer can then use any lightning wallet on their own device to pay the invoice. The payment will be received in the shop owner's Strike account instantly. </p>
